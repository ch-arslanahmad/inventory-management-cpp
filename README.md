This was a group project completed with a fellow student as part of coursework. I was primarily responsible for the overall implementation, including planning, coding, and testing.

## Project Overview

This Inventory Management System is a console-based application written in C++.  
It allows users to manage product records including:

- Searching by product name  
- Adding new items  
- Removing entries  
- Updating product details  
- Viewing the complete inventory  

Each product consists of:
- Name
- Price
- Quantity

## Algorithm Summary

```text
1. Start
2. Load default inventory
3. Display menu options
4. Take user input of the choice
5. Execute the choice:
   - Search / Add / Remove / Update / View / Exit
6. Loop until user exits
```

## Applications

This system has real-world and educational use cases:

- Managing stock for small businesses or home-based shops  
- Teaching basic programming concepts in C++  
- Prototyping point-of-sale or inventory software  
- Organizing personal collections (books, tools, etc.)

## Notes

This project was developed as part of the **Programming Fundamentals** course in Semester 2.  
It demonstrates foundational concepts in C++ such as:

- Loops and conditionals  
- Functions and user-defined structures  
- Vector manipulation  
- Console I/O handling
