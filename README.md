## 📌 Project Overview

This Inventory Management System is a console-based application written in C++.  
It allows users to manage product records including:

- 🔍 Searching by product name  
- ➕ Adding new items  
- 🗑️ Removing entries  
- ✏️ Updating product details  
- 📋 Viewing the complete inventory  

Each product consists of:
- Name
- Price
- Quantity
