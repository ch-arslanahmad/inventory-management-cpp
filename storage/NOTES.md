# NOTES

I am currently using SQLite as a DB.

- Had to install dependencies or libraries or header files for it.

- So installed sqlite3 (CLI version) & libsqlite3 (for core stuff)

```bash
sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
```

But its too verbose, hence an easy solution, i found was `sqlite_modern_cpp`, its syntax is quite easy and clear.
